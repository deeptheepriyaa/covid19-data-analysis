COVID-19 Data Analysis with Visualizations
This project analyzes COVID-19 data using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to gain insights into the pandemic's trends. It includes data collection, preprocessing, visualization, and interpretation.
Features
Data Collection: Fetch COVID-19 datasets from sources like Kaggle or Johns Hopkins University.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values, format dates, and filter relevant data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.
Visualizations:
Time-series trends of cases and deaths
Geographical heatmaps using Folium
Country-wise comparison of COVID-19 spread
Statistical Analysis: Use scikit-learn for correlation analysis.
